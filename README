This is a library for interfacing with Twitter.

It is under development now, and as a result is not even close to finished.

If you want to use it, go ahead. It'll post and do everything fine, but won't parse down loaded results.

That'll be the next step.

License?

Go crazy, do whatever with it, just give me a tiny bit of credit, okay?
